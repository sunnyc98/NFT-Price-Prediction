# NFT-Price-Prediction (LSTM, RL, Regression)

Codes for a team project on the price prediction of NFT's using regression with regularization methods, Stacked LSTM and Reinforce Learning models.

Used Open-AI Gym and Stable-baselines3 for the RL environment and algorithms (A2C, PPO).

Evaluation metrics used to compare the models were RMSE and R^2 scores, and some of the results are shown below.
